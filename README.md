# Railway-Maintainance-and-Intelligent-Scheduling-System
It is an application that is build specially build for railway employees to check the progress of the tracks.
This full-stack web application is built with a structured architecture separating the frontend, backend, and database components.

The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a responsive, fast, and framework-independent user experience.

The backend uses a hybrid setup consisting of Node.js for server routing, API creation, request handling, authentication, and real-time operations.

Additional backend functionality is powered by Python, which handles processing-heavy tasks, automation scripts, data analysis, or special computation modules.

The application interacts with a MongoDB database, offering a flexible NoSQL document structure for storing user data, logs, and dynamic content.

Node.js and Python services communicate with MongoDB using efficient database drivers for quick read/write operations.

The project is organized with separate folders for frontend and backend code, ensuring clean modularity and easy maintenance.

To run the project locally, the user installs dependencies for both Node.js (npm install) and Python (pip install -r requirements.txt if applicable).

Environment variables such as PORT, MONGO_URI, and any secret keys must be stored in a .env file inside the backend directory.

The frontend can be served through any static server, while the Node.js backend is started using npm start or node server.js.

Python scripts or services are run independently or triggered by the Node.js backend depending on project logic.

The system supports features like REST APIs, form submission, authentication (optional), CRUD operations, UI interactions, and backend-driven data processing.

Deployment can be done by hosting the frontend on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static hosting service.

The Node.js + Python backend can be deployed on platforms such as Render, Railway, Heroku, AWS EC2, or any cloud service with support for both runtimes.

The architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and efficient performance across all layers of the application.
